      question_text: "In the STAR method, what percentage of your answer should focus on the Action component?"
      options:
        - "10-15%"
        - "25-30%"
        - "50-60%"
        - "70-80%"
      correct_answer: 2  # Index 2 = "50-60%"
      explanation: "The Action section should comprise 50-60% of your answer. This is where you demonstrate your skills, judgment, and approach—the core of what interviewers want to assess."

      question_text: "What is the ideal total length for a STAR-formatted behavioral answer?"
      options:
        - "30 seconds to 1 minute"
        - "2-3 minutes"
        - "5-7 minutes"
        - "As long as needed to tell the full story"
      correct_answer: 1  # Index 1 = "2-3 minutes"
      explanation: "Behavioral answers should be 2-3 minutes. Under 2 minutes typically lacks depth, while over 3 minutes risks losing the interviewer's attention. Practice with a timer to calibrate."

        - "The feature launched on time"
        - "My manager said it was one of the best projects they'd seen"
      correct_answer: 1  # Index 1 = specific metrics
      explanation: "Quantified results with specific metrics (40% reduction, 15% improvement) are most compelling. They provide concrete evidence of impact rather than subjective assessments."

        - "Describe what the team accomplished without specifying individual roles"
        - "Focus primarily on what others did wrong that you had to fix"
      correct_answer: 1  # Index 1 = "I" statements
      explanation: "Use 'I' statements to make your personal contribution clear. While acknowledging team efforts is good, interviewers need to understand YOUR specific actions and decisions."

        - "Brief context about when/where, relevant background, and key constraints"
        - "A dramatic setup to make the story more engaging"
      correct_answer: 2  # Index 2 = brief context
      explanation: "The Situation should provide just enough context (when, where, relevant background, constraints) for the interviewer to understand the circumstances. Keep it to 15-20 seconds—save time for Actions and Results."

        sample_answer: |
          Situation: Last year, our team was tasked with migrating our payment system to a new provider within 6 weeks before our contract expired. The project had been delayed twice before due to lack of clear ownership.

          Task: I volunteered to lead the migration even though I wasn't the most senior engineer, because I had experience with the new provider from a previous role. My goal was to deliver the migration with zero downtime and no customer impact.

          Action: I started by creating a detailed project plan with clear milestones and owners for each component. I set up daily standups to surface blockers quickly. When our database team pushed back on the timeline, I worked with them to understand their concerns and we agreed on a phased approach that addressed their risks. I also created a runbook for the cutover and ran two dry-run migrations on staging to build team confidence.

          Result: We completed the migration in 5 weeks with zero downtime. The phased approach we developed became the template for future migrations. I was asked to lead two subsequent infrastructure projects based on this experience.

        sample_answer: |
          Situation: On my previous team, a senior engineer and I had a significant disagreement about the architecture for a new feature. He wanted to use a microservices approach, while I believed a monolithic solution would ship faster and be easier to maintain at our scale. The disagreement was creating tension and blocking the project.

          Task: As the feature lead, I needed to resolve the conflict quickly while maintaining a good working relationship. We couldn't afford to lose either perspective or let the project stall.

          Action: I asked him to grab coffee away from the team to discuss. I started by genuinely trying to understand his concerns—it turned out he'd been burned by monolithic technical debt at a previous company. I acknowledged his experience and shared my reasoning about our current scale. I proposed we create a decision matrix together, evaluating both approaches against our actual constraints. We agreed on objective criteria: time to market, maintenance burden, and ability to scale if needed.

          Result: The framework showed that a modular monolith with clear boundaries addressed both our concerns. He appreciated that I'd taken time to understand his perspective rather than just pushing my view. We ended up with a better architecture than either original proposal, and we've collaborated smoothly since then.

          result: "What was the impact? What did you learn? How have you applied that learning?"
        sample_answer: |
          Situation: Early in my career, I was responsible for launching a feature that I thought was fully tested. I was eager to ship and skipped some of the manual testing steps I'd planned because automated tests were passing.

          Task: I owned the feature end-to-end, including quality assurance before release. We had committed to a launch date with the marketing team.

          Action: I pushed to production on Thursday afternoon. Within hours, we started getting customer complaints about a critical bug in an edge case my automated tests didn't cover. The bug affected about 5% of users but included some of our largest customers. I had to work through the weekend to fix it and personally emailed affected customers to apologize.

          Result: We lost one mid-sized customer who was already considering alternatives. More importantly, I damaged my team's trust and our relationship with marketing. The learning that stuck with me: automated tests are necessary but not sufficient, and never ship before a weekend. Since then, I've built proper testing checklists and established a 'no Friday deploys' norm on teams I've led. I've shared this story with junior engineers to help them avoid the same mistake.

        sample_answer: |
          Situation: Our e-commerce platform was experiencing intermittent slowdowns that were costing us an estimated $50K per month in abandoned carts. The issue had been occurring for three months but no one had been able to diagnose the root cause. It only happened during peak traffic and wasn't reproducible in our test environment.

          Task: I was asked to lead the investigation and find a fix. I had two weeks before our biggest sale of the year, when the problem would be most damaging.

          Action: I started by gathering data—I pulled metrics from the past 90 days and correlated slowdowns with various factors. I noticed the issues clustered around specific times that didn't match our expected traffic peaks. I hypothesized it might be related to background jobs, so I analyzed our job scheduler logs. I found that our recommendation engine's batch jobs were coinciding with traffic spikes. The jobs were configured for off-peak hours, but someone had changed the timezone setting months ago without documenting it. I tested my hypothesis by temporarily disabling the jobs during a busy period—performance normalized.

          Result: The fix was a one-line configuration change. Response times during peak hours improved by 60%, and we saw a 12% reduction in cart abandonment. I documented the root cause and implemented monitoring to alert if similar job/traffic conflicts occurred in the future.

          Situation: My team wanted to adopt a new testing framework that would improve our development speed, but our engineering director was skeptical. He'd seen previous tool adoptions fail and was concerned about the learning curve disrupting our deliverables.

          Task: I needed to convince him to approve a trial period for the new framework. We couldn't adopt it without his support, and the team was frustrated with our current tooling.

          Action: First, I made sure I understood his concerns—I scheduled a 1:1 and asked open-ended questions about his previous experiences with tool adoptions. I learned his main worry was productivity dropping for 2-3 months during transition. Armed with this insight, I proposed a low-risk pilot: one team, one quarter, with clear success metrics. I created a rollback plan showing exactly how we'd revert if metrics declined. I also found two case studies from similar-sized companies who had adopted the framework successfully. Finally, I offered to personally own the pilot and check in with him weekly.

          Result: He approved the pilot. After 6 weeks, our test coverage increased 25% with no productivity loss. He not only approved full adoption but cited our structured approach when proposing other changes to leadership. The experience taught me that understanding someone's underlying concerns is more effective than arguing about surface-level objections.
        evaluation_criteria:
