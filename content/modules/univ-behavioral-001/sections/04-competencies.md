# Core Competency Categories

## Understanding What Interviewers Really Want

Every behavioral question maps to one or more **competencies**—the skills and traits companies look for in candidates. Understanding these categories helps you:

1. Recognize what a question is actually assessing
2. Choose the right story from your bank
3. Emphasize the most relevant aspects of your experience

Let's explore the five core competency categories you'll encounter across all companies.

---

## 1. Leadership

**What it measures:** Your ability to influence outcomes, guide others, and take ownership.

**Common question patterns:**
- "Tell me about a time you led a project/team..."
- "Describe a situation where you had to influence without authority..."
- "Give an example of when you took initiative..."

**What interviewers look for:**

| Signal | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Taking ownership | "I volunteered to lead when no one else stepped up" |
| Influencing others | "I convinced the team to try a different approach" |
| Making decisions | "I decided to cut scope to meet the deadline" |
| Developing others | "I mentored a junior engineer through the problem" |

**Important note:** Leadership doesn't require a management title. Individual contributors demonstrate leadership through technical influence, mentoring, and driving initiatives.

**Sample question:** "Tell me about a time you led a team through a difficult challenge."

## 2. Collaboration & Teamwork

**What it measures:** How effectively you work with others to achieve shared goals.

**Common question patterns:**
- "Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult colleague..."
- "Describe how you handled a disagreement with a teammate..."
- "Give an example of successful cross-functional collaboration..."

**What interviewers look for:**

| Signal | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Building relationships | "I scheduled regular 1:1s to understand their concerns" |
| Managing conflict constructively | "I focused on the shared goal rather than who was right" |
| Sharing credit | "The success was really due to the whole team's effort" |
| Seeking diverse input | "I made sure to get perspectives from design and ops" |

**Watch out for:** Questions about "difficult people" are testing whether you can be diplomatic and professional, not whether you can complain eloquently about past colleagues.

**Sample question:** "Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a coworker. How did you resolve it?"

## 3. Problem-Solving & Analytical Thinking

**What it measures:** Your approach to understanding and solving complex problems.

**Common question patterns:**
- "Tell me about a complex problem you solved..."
- "Describe a time you had to make a decision with incomplete information..."
- "Give an example of when you used data to drive a decision..."

**What interviewers look for:**

| Signal | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Breaking down complexity | "I divided the problem into three sub-problems" |
| Gathering information | "I interviewed five users to understand the real issue" |
| Considering alternatives | "I evaluated three different approaches" |
| Using data | "The metrics showed that option B had 40% better outcomes" |

**Pro tip:** Even if your solution wasn't perfect, demonstrating a structured thought process is valuable. Interviewers appreciate candidates who can articulate *how* they think.

**Sample question:** "Tell me about the most complex problem you've solved in your career."

## 4. Adaptability & Resilience

**What it measures:** How you handle change, setbacks, and ambiguity.

**Common question patterns:**
- "Tell me about a time you failed..."
- "Describe a situation where priorities changed suddenly..."
- "Give an example of when you had to learn something quickly..."

**What interviewers look for:**

| Signal | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Embracing change | "I saw the pivot as an opportunity rather than a setback" |
| Learning from failure | "The experience taught me to validate assumptions earlier" |
| Staying calm under pressure | "I focused on what we could control" |
| Rapid skill acquisition | "I got up to speed on the new framework in two weeks" |

**Critical insight:** Failure questions are not traps—they're opportunities. Companies want to hire people who can learn and grow. A candidate who has never failed either hasn't taken on challenging work or lacks self-awareness.

**Sample question:** "Tell me about a time you failed. What did you learn?"

---

## 5. Communication

**What it measures:** Your ability to convey information clearly and listen effectively.

**Common question patterns:**
- "Tell me about a time you had to explain something technical to a non-technical audience..."
- "Describe a situation where miscommunication caused a problem..."
- "Give an example of how you influenced a decision through communication..."

**What interviewers look for:**

| Signal | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Clarity | "I created a one-page summary instead of a 20-slide deck" |
| Audience awareness | "I adjusted my explanation for the executives' priorities" |
| Active listening | "I realized I had misunderstood their concern, so I asked clarifying questions" |
| Written communication | "I documented the decision so the team had a reference" |

**Note:** Your behavioral interview itself is a communication assessment. How you structure and deliver your STAR answers demonstrates this competency in real-time.

**Sample question:** "Tell me about a time you had to persuade someone to see things your way."

## Competency Mapping by Question Type

Here's a quick reference for mapping common questions to competencies:

| Question Theme | Primary Competency | Secondary Competency |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Leading a project | Leadership | Problem-Solving |
| Handling conflict | Collaboration | Communication |
| Dealing with failure | Adaptability | Problem-Solving |
| Meeting tight deadlines | Problem-Solving | Adaptability |
| Working cross-functionally | Collaboration | Communication |
| Influencing without authority | Leadership | Communication |
| Learning new skills | Adaptability | Problem-Solving |
| Making difficult decisions | Leadership | Problem-Solving |
| Receiving critical feedback | Adaptability | Collaboration |
| Explaining complex topics | Communication | Problem-Solving |

## Company-Specific Competency Emphasis

While all companies assess these core competencies, emphasis varies:

| Company | Primary Focus |
|---------|--------------|
| Amazon | Leadership (via Leadership Principles) |
| Google | Problem-Solving, Collaboration ("Googleyness") |
| Meta | Adaptability, Communication ("Move Fast") |
| Microsoft | Collaboration, Leadership ("Growth Mindset") |
| Apple | Problem-Solving, Communication (attention to detail) |
| Consulting | Communication, Problem-Solving (structured thinking) |

You'll learn company-specific nuances in dedicated modules. For now, focus on building stories that demonstrate all five core competencies.
