# Introduction to Behavioral Interviews

## What Are Behavioral Interviews?

Behavioral interviews are based on a simple premise: **past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior**. Instead of asking hypothetical questions like "What would you do if...?", interviewers ask about specific situations you've actually experienced.

When an interviewer asks "Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a difficult coworker," they want to hear a real story from your past. Your answer reveals how you actually handle challenges, not how you imagine you might.

## Why Every Company Uses Them

Behavioral interviews have become universal because they work. Research shows that structured behavioral interviews are **twice as predictive** of job performance compared to unstructured conversations.

You'll encounter behavioral questions at:

- **Big Tech companies** (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple)
- **Startups** of all sizes
- **Consulting firms** (McKinsey, BCG, Bain)
- **Finance** (Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan)
- **Every other industry** you can think of

The format may vary—some companies dedicate entire rounds to behavioral questions, while others weave them throughout technical interviews—but the core approach remains the same.

## What Interviewers Are Really Evaluating

When you answer a behavioral question, interviewers assess multiple dimensions:

| Dimension | What They're Looking For |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Competency fit** | Do you have the skills this role requires? |
| **Culture alignment** | Will you thrive in our environment? |
| **Self-awareness** | Do you understand your strengths and growth areas? |
| **Communication** | Can you articulate complex situations clearly? |
| **Judgment** | Do you make sound decisions under pressure? |

## The Good News: Preparation Works

Unlike some interview formats where raw talent plays a large role, behavioral interviews reward preparation. With the right framework and practice, you can:

- Structure your experiences into compelling narratives
- Anticipate the most likely questions
- Adapt your stories to different question types
- Deliver your answers with confidence

This module will teach you exactly how to do all of this. By the end, you'll have a systematic approach to behavioral interviews that you can apply at any company.
