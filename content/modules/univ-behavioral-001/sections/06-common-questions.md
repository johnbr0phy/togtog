## Handling Questions You Haven't Prepared For

Even with thorough preparation, you may encounter unexpected questions. Here's your safety net:

1. **Pause briefly** (2-3 seconds) to think—this is normal and expected
2. **Identify the competency** being assessed
3. **Scan your story bank** for a relevant experience
4. **Adapt** your story to address the specific question
5. **Use STAR** to structure your response

If you truly can't think of an example:
> "I haven't faced that exact situation, but here's a related experience that demonstrates how I approach [competency]..."

This is far better than making something up or saying "I don't know."
