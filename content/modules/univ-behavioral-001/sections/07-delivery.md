# Delivery and Presentation

## Beyond Content: How You Say It Matters

Having great stories structured with STAR is only half the equation. How you *deliver* those stories significantly impacts how they land. This section covers the presentation skills that separate good candidates from great ones.

## Pacing and Timing

### The 2-3 Minute Rule

Most behavioral answers should land between 2-3 minutes. Here's why:

| Duration | Impression |
|----------|-----------|
| Under 1 minute | Too brief—lacks detail and depth |
| 1-2 minutes | Acceptable for simpler questions |
| **2-3 minutes** | **Ideal—thorough but focused** |
| 3-4 minutes | Getting long—interviewer may lose focus |
| Over 4 minutes | Too long—rambling, unfocused |

### How to Calibrate

- **Practice with a timer** until you internalize 2-3 minutes
- **Watch for cues:** If the interviewer looks away or checks the time, wrap up
- **Build in checkpoints:** After your Action section, you can ask "Should I continue with the results, or would you like more detail on any part?"

### Pacing Tips

- **Don't rush:** Nervous energy makes people speed up. Consciously slow down.
- **Use pauses:** A 1-2 second pause after a key point lets it land.
- **Vary your pace:** Slightly faster for context, slower for key insights.

## Body Language and Presence

### Posture

- **Sit up straight** but not rigidly—aim for "alert and engaged"
- **Lean slightly forward** when listening to show interest
- **Avoid fidgeting:** Keep hands visible and relatively still
- **Don't cross arms:** It reads as defensive

### Eye Contact

- **For in-person:** Maintain natural eye contact 60-70% of the time
- **For video:** Look at the camera (not the screen) when speaking
- **With panels:** Make eye contact with each person, especially when answering their question
- **When thinking:** Looking briefly to the side is fine—staring at the ceiling looks uncertain

### Hand Gestures

- **Use natural gestures** to emphasize points
- **Keep hands visible:** Hiding them (under the table) reduces trust signals
- **Avoid:** Pointing, excessive gesturing, touching your face

## Vocal Delivery

### Tone

- **Conversational:** You're telling a story to a colleague, not presenting to a board
- **Confident:** Avoid hedging language ("I think maybe I sort of...")
- **Enthusiastic:** Show genuine engagement, especially for achievement questions

### Common Vocal Pitfalls

| Pitfall | How It Sounds | How to Fix |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Uptalk | Every sentence sounds like a question? | Practice ending with downward inflection |
| Monotone | No variation, sounds rehearsed | Emphasize key words, vary pitch |
| Filler words | "Um, like, you know, basically" | Pause instead of filling silence |
| Trailing off | Ending sentences quietly... | Commit to your final words |
| Speaking too fast | Nervousness accelerates pace | Breathe, pause between sentences |

### Power Phrases vs. Weak Phrases

| Weak | Powerful |
|------|----------|
| "I think I did well" | "The results exceeded expectations" |
| "We kind of decided to" | "I recommended we" |
| "It wasn't really my idea but" | "Building on the team's input, I" |
| "I guess it worked out" | "The outcome was" |
| "Sorry, this is a long story" | "Let me walk you through the key points" |

## Managing Nerves

### Before the Interview

- **Prepare thoroughly:** Confidence comes from preparation
- **Arrive early:** Rushing increases anxiety
- **Power pose:** 2 minutes of expansive posture can reduce stress hormones
- **Review your stories:** Quick mental run-through, not cramming

### During the Interview

- **Breathe:** Deep breath before starting each answer
- **Pause:** It's okay to take 3-5 seconds to collect your thoughts
- **Reframe nerves:** Physiologically, anxiety and excitement are similar—tell yourself you're excited
- **Have a reset phrase:** If you lose your place, say "Let me step back and clarify..."

### If You Go Blank

It happens to everyone. Here's how to recover:

1. **Acknowledge briefly:** "That's a great question. Let me think for a moment."
2. **Buy time:** Take a sip of water (always have some nearby)
3. **Bridge:** "I want to give you a thoughtful answer. The situation that comes to mind is..."
4. **Start with Situation:** Even if you're not sure where the story goes, beginning with context often triggers the rest

## Video Interview Specifics

Video interviews have unique challenges:

### Technical Setup

- **Camera at eye level:** Stack books under laptop if needed
- **Good lighting:** Face a window or use a ring light; avoid backlighting
- **Neutral background:** Clean, professional, non-distracting
- **Test beforehand:** Audio, video, internet connection
- **Close other apps:** Prevent notifications and reduce bandwidth competition

### Engagement Tips

- **Look at camera:** This creates "eye contact" for the interviewer
- **Exaggerate slightly:** Energy doesn't transmit as well over video
- **Nod visibly:** Shows you're listening since subtle cues are lost
- **Speak clearly:** Audio compression can muffle mumbling

### Common Video Pitfalls

- Looking at yourself instead of the camera
- Forgetting you're on camera when "listening"
- Technical issues you haven't prepared for
- Distracting environment (pets, family, notifications)

## The Meta-Skill: Reading the Room

Great interviewers adapt in real-time:

### Signs to Continue

- Interviewer is nodding, leaning in
- They're taking notes
- Eye contact is maintained
- They ask follow-up questions

### Signs to Wrap Up

- Interviewer glances at clock or screen
- Body language becomes restless
- They start looking at their next question
- Responses become shorter ("Mmhmm," "Got it")

### Responding to Interruptions

If the interviewer interrupts:
- **Stop talking immediately:** Don't try to finish your point
- **Listen carefully:** They may want clarification or are redirecting
- **Answer their question directly:** Don't return to where you were unless asked
- **Don't take offense:** Time pressure may be the cause

## Practice Methods

### Solo Practice

- **Record yourself:** Video reveals habits you don't notice
- **Use a timer:** Build intuition for 2-3 minute answers
- **Practice in interview clothes:** Reduces novelty on the day

### Partner Practice

- **Trade mock interviews:** With a friend preparing for interviews
- **Request specific feedback:** "Was I too long? Did I use filler words?"
- **Simulate conditions:** Use video if your interview will be remote

### Professional Options

- Mock interviews with career coaches
- Company-specific prep services
- Interview platforms with AI feedback
